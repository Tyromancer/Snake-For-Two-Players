Snake-For-Two-Players

This application is a modified version of the game "Snake".
Two players can play against each other on a local machine by using two sets of key bindings.
In addition to the original "point items", this application has items that can boost a player's speed or decrease it.

Also, snakes controlled by the computer will spawn on the game board and wander around. When the computer controlled
 snakes die, they will become "points" that can be collected by the players

There is also an upper limit of points a player can have. If one of the two players reach this limit, that player will
 win the game
